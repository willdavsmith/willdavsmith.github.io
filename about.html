			<p class="box_text text">
				I am Will (David) Smith, an undergrad at Indiana University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I plan to focus my studies on Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. My areas of interest include web development as well as general programming, where I have experience in languages such as Java, Python, Racket, and JavaScript. In general, I see myself as well-balanced and a quick learner, enthusiastic about nearly all aspects in the world of Computer Science. <br><br>
				I also have experience in various practical programs, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. I have been working with computers almost my whole life and have a solid grasp on computer hardware. I am adept in both Linux commands and Git version control, and I am able to handle large projects and collaboration. <br><br>
				Apart from the tech world, Also, I am involved in various organizations and communities, such as student government and entrepreneurship. I have a passion for history, culture, and I am especially interested in the way that computing relates to society at large.
